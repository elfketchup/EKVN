 VNSystemCall
 
 This class is built specifically to handle ".SYSTEMCALL" commands that are used in the VN system. These types of commands
 are mainly used for game-specific tasks that need to be called/accessed/controlled from within the VN system. Examples
 may include autosaving the game, logging diagnostic information, or starting mini-games.
 
 Currently, this class only supports the first two uses, and only at the most basic level. It's recommended that developers
 modify/extend this class for their own purposes.

// This tries to autosave the game; it assumes that the player is currently using the VN system.
