 VNScene
 
 VNScene is the main class for displaying and interacting with the Visual Novel system (or "VN system") I've coded.
 VNScene works by taking script data (interpreted from a Property List file using VNScript), and processes
 the script to handle audio and display graphics, text, and basic animation. It also handles user input for playing
 the scene and user choices, plus saving related data to EKRecord.
 
 Visual and audio elements are handled by VNScene; sprites and sounds are stored in a mutable dictionary and mutable array, 
 respectively. A record of the dialogue scene / visual-novel elements is kept by VNScene, and can be copied over to EKRecord 
 (and from EKRecord, into device memory) when necessary. During certain "volatile" periods (like when performing effects or
 presenting the player with a menu of choices), VNScene will store that record in a "safe save," which is created just before
 the effect/choice-menu is run, and holds the data from "the last time it was safe to save the game." Afterwards, when VNScene
 resumes "normal" activity, then the safe-save is removed and any attempts to save the game will just draw data from the
 "normal" record.
 
 When processing script data from VNScript, the script is divided into "conversations," which are really an NSArray
 of text/NSString objects that have been converted to string and number data to be more easily processed. Different "conversations"
 represent branching paths in the script. When VNScene begins processing script data, it always starts with a converation
 named "start".

 Coding/readability notes
 
 NOTE: What would become VNScene was originally written as part of a visual-novel game engine that I made in conjuction
       with a custom sprite-drawing kit written in OpenGL ES v1. At that time, it used the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model,
       where there were separate classes for each.
 
       Later, I ported the code over to Cocos2D (which worked MUCH better than my custom graphics kit), and the View and
       Controller classes were mixed together to form VNScene, while VNScript held the Model information. I've tried
       to clean up the code so it would make sense to reflect how things work now, but there are still some quirks and
       "leftovers" from the prior version of the code.
 
       Added January 2014: Also, upgrading to Cocos2D v3.0 caused some other changes to be made. VNScene used to be VNLayer,
       and inherited from CCLayer. Since that class has been removed, VNScene now inherits from CCScene. As some other
       Cocos2D classes have been renamed or had major changes, the classes in EKVN that relied on Cocos2D have had to change
       or be renamed alongside that. I've cleaned up the code somewhat, but it's possible that there are still some comments
       and other references to the "old" version of Cocos2D that I haven't spotted!
 
       Added September 2014: EKVN SpriteKit has been ported from cocos2d to -- as you might have guessed -- SpriteKit.
       The two are kind of similar, but there are enough differences to make seemingly normal things (like positioning nodes)
       act differently. To maintain compatibility with the "regular" EKVN that uses cocos2d, a lot of old code (and commments!) have been
       left in, but hacked/patched to work with SpriteKit. In short, some things are going to look a little confusing.
