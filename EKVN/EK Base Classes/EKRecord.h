 EKRecord
 
 This class works by storing game data in NSUserDefaults. There are two types of data; the "global" data
 that remains the same across all saved games / new games, and then the data that's stored inside "slots"
 and is only relevant within a particular playthrough of the game.
 
 The "global" relevant-across-all-playthroughs data is just stored in NSUserDefault's "root" dictionary
 as either NSString or NSNumber objects. Conversely, an entire slot is stored as a single NSData object
 in the root dictionary. Each slot can be accessed through the dictionary key "slotX", where X is the
 number.
 
 The main Global values are:
   1. HIGH SCORE (NSUInteger) - The highest score achieved by a player
   2. DATE SAVED (NSDate object) - Time and date of most recent saved game
   3. CURRENT SLOT (NSUInteger) - Which save slot was most recently used
 
 Slot Zero ("slot0") is the default slot, and is meant mostly for autosave data. If you're creating a game
 where it's not necessary to have multiple slots/games/playthroughs, then you can just store everything
 in Slot Zero. On the other hand, some other game types (such as, say, JRPGs) might require multiple slots.
 There is no hard-coded limit on the number of slots you can use.

 Each slot is an NSData object, which can be decoded into a single NSDictionary (or more practically,
 an NSMutableDictionary) called the Record, which holds the following values:
 
   1. ACTIVITY TYPE (NSString) - What kind of activity the player was engaged in when the game was saved
                                 (a specific mini-game, cutscene, etc)
   2. ACTIVITY DICTIONARY (NSDictionary) - Stores information specific to that activity (sprite positions, score, etc)
   3. FLAG DATA (NSDictionary) - A dictionary of flags (each flag is a key that corresponds to an int value)
 
 An Activity is a particular task/mini-game that the player is involved with. This could be a particular level
 in the game, a dialogue/cutscene sequence, a mini-game, traversing a map of the world, etc. The Activity Dictionary
 holds information specific to an Activity type, such as mini-game scores, locations of sprites, level data, etc.
 When the game is saved, the player's current Activity should save any relevant data, and when the game is loaded,
 that same data is supposed to recreate the Activity exactly as the player left it (or something close enough
 that the player shouldn't complain too much!)
 
 Flags are information not specific to a particular activity, but can instead be used throughout a particular
 playthrough of the game. For example, relationships scores in regards to other characters, progress through
 a story, experience points and money, etc. In theory, as long as anything can be stored as an integer value
 and is used throughout the playthrough, it can be stored as a flag. (It's also possible to store flags with
 non-integer data, but ints are the standard value type... nevertheless, if you want to use another data
 type entirely, that can be done).
 
 Since the Record can be accessed by any class that knows of EKRecord, it's also possible to add further data,
 in case the combination of Flags and Activity data isn't enough. It's not "officially" supported, but it can
 certainly be done.
 
 EKRecord is meant to be used as a singleton, and having multiple EKRecord objects in existence may lead to
 unknown/untested behaviors, especially since they all write data to the same NSUserDefaults dictionary.
 
 In the future, functionality for saving to iCloud or to actual files (as opposed to NSUserDefaults) may be
 added, but for now EKRecord works well enough.

 Persistent Records
 
 The persistent records functions somewhat similarly to flags in that they keep track of various types of information.
 Unlike flags, they're usually NOT simple integers (or number objects) and instead usually hold arrays and dictionaries.
 
 Persistent records are meant for things
