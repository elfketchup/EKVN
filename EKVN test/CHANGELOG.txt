version 1.1.9.5 May-01-2015
. [NEW] .PLAYMUSIC script command changed to support fade-in/fade-out transitions.

version 1.1.9.4 Apr-28-2015
. [NEW] Added .SCALEBACKGROUND and .SCALESPRITE script commands to dynamically resize backgrounds and sprites.

version 1.1.9.3 Apr-26-2015
. [NEW] Added .MODIFYCHOICEBOXOFFSET script command to adjust the position of buttons during "make a choice" segments.

version 1.1.9.2 Apr-20-2015

version 1.1.9.1 Apr-01-2015
. [NEW] Added .SETSPEECHBOX script command to dynamically change the speechbox sprite on the fly.

version 1.1.9 Mar-25-2015
. [FIX] Fixed how typewriter text handled display when the user taps the screen.

version 1.1.8 Mar-10-2015
. [NEW] Added a feature in the main menu where the screen fades to black and music fades out when starting a new game or loading a saved game. To enable this, just add "fade out time in seconds" to the file "main_menu.plist" and make sure the Type is set to "Number." Otherwise, if this key-value pairing doesn't exist in main_menu.plist, then EKVN will just use the previous method of NOT fading-out either the sound or the graphics and instead just instantly start/load the game.

version 1.1.7 Feb-11-2015
. [NEW] Added a "Typewriter Text" mode (activated/deactivated in script using the .SETTYPEWRITERTEXT command). When active, this causes text to appear one character at a time, instead of the previous way where the text faded into view. (Warning: this is a semi-experimental quick-and-dirty hack! It'll probably work without incident… probably.)

version 1.1.6 Feb-03-2015
. [NEW] Added a "cinematic text" mode (activated/deactivated in script using the .SETCINEMATICTEXT command). This causes the text/dialogue to advance without user input after a certain period of time.

version 1.1.5 Nov-01-2014
. [NEW] Added “no skipping until text is shown” Boolean flag to “vnscene view settings.plist” (and VNScene), which prevents skipping dialogue until the text has completely appeared on screen (default value for flag is “NO”)

version 1.1.4 May-12-2014
. [NEW] Can now edit main_menu.plist to have music playing in the opening menu.

version 1.1.3 Apr-13-2014
