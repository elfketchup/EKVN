
  Name: .ADDSPRITE

  Uses Cocos2D to add a sprite to the screen. By default, the sprite usually appears right
  at the center of the screen.

  Parameters:

      #1: Sprite name (string) (example: "girl.png")
          Quite simply, the name of a file where the sprite is. Currently, the VN system doesn't
          support sprite sheets, so it needs to be a single image in a single file.

      #2: (OPTIONAL) Sprite appears at once? (Boolean value) (example: "NO") (default is NO)
          If set to YES, the sprite appears immediately (no fade-in). If set to NO, then the
          sprite "gradually" fades in (though the fade-in usually takes a second or less).

Example: .addsprite:girl.png:NO

================

  Name: .ALIGNSPRITE

  Aligns a particular sprite in either the center, left, or right ends of the screen. This is done
  by finding the center of the sprite and setting the X coordinate to either 25% of the screen's
  width (on the iPhone 4S, this is 480*0.25 or 120), 50% (the middle), or 75% (the right).

  There's also the Far Left (the left border of the screen), Far Right (the right border of the screen),
  and Extreme Left and Extremem Right, which are so far that the sprite is drawn offscreen.

  Parameters:

      #1: Name of sprite (string) (example: "girl.png")
          This is the name of the sprite to manipulate/align. All sprites currently displayed by the
          VN system are kept track of in the scene, so if the sprite exists onscreen, it'll be found.

      #2: Alignment name (string) (example: "left") (default is "center")
          (Other, more unusual values also include FAR LEFT, FAR RIGHT, EXTREME LEFT, EXTREME RIGHT)
          Determines whether to move the sprite to the LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT of the screen.

          It has to be one of those values; partial/percentage values aren't supported.

      #2: (OPTIONAL) Alignment duration in SECONDS (double value) (example: "0.5") (Default is 0.5)
          Determines how long it takes for the sprite to move from its current position to the
          new position. Setting it to zero makes the transition instant. Time is measured in seconds.

  Example: .alignsprite:girl.png:center

================

  Name: .REMOVESPRITE

  Removes a sprite from the screen, assuming that it's part of the VN system's dictionary of
  existing sprite objects.

  Parameters:

      #1: Name of sprite (string) (example: "girl.png")
          This is the name of the sprite to manipulate/align. All sprites currently displayed by the
          VN system are kept track of in the scene, so if the sprite exists onscreen, it'll be found.

      #2: (OPTIONAL) Sprite appears at once (Boolean value) (example: "NO") (Default is NO)
          Determines whether the sprite disappears from the screen instantly or fades out gradually.

  Example: .removesprite:girl.png:NO

================

  Name: .MOVESPRITE

  Uses Cocos2D actions to move a sprite by a certain number of points.

  Parameters:

   (note that all parameters after the first are TECHNICALLY optional, but if you use one,
    you had better call the ones that come before it!)

      #1: The name of the sprite to move (string) (example: "girl.png")

      #2: Amount to move sprite by X points (float) (example: 128) (default is ZERO)

      #3: Amount to move the sprite by Y points (float) (example: 256) (default is ZERO)

      #4: Duration in seconds (float) (example: 0.5) (default is 0.5 seconds)
          This measures how long it takes to move the sprite, in seconds.

  Example: .movesprite:girl.png:128:-128:1.0

================

  Name: .SETSPRITEPOSITION

  NOTE that unlike .MOVESPRITE, this call is instantaneous. I don't remember why I made it that
  way (probably since sprites usually don't move instantly in most visual novels), but it's probably
  best to keep things simple like that anyways.

  Parameters:

      #1: The name of the sprite (string) (example: "girl.png")

      #2: The sprite's X coordinate, in points (float) (example: 10)

      #3: The sprite's Y coordinate, in points (float) (example: 10)

  Example: .setspriteposition:girl.png:100:100


================

  Name: .SETBACKGROUND

  Changes whatever image (if any) is used as the background. You can set this to 'nil' which removes
  the background entirely, and shows whatever is behind. This is useful if you're overlaying the VN
  scene over an existing Cocos2D layer/scene node.

  Unlike some of the other image-switching commands, this one is supposed to do the change instantly.
  It might be helpful to fade-out and then fade-in the scene during transistions so that the background
  change isn't too jarring for the person playing the game.

  Parameters:

      #1: The name of the background image (string) (example: "beach.png")

  Example: .setbackground:beach.png

================

  Name: .MOVEBACKGROUND

  Uses Cocos2D actions to move the background by a certain number of points. This is normally used to
  pan the background (along the X-axis), but you can move the background up and down as well. Character
  sprites can also be moved along with the background, though usually at a slightly different rate;
  the rate is referred to as the "parallax factor." A parallax factor of 1.0 means that the character
  sprites move just as quickly as the background does, while a factor 0.0 means that the character
  sprites do not move at all.

  Parameters:

      #1: Amount to move sprite by X points (float) (example: 128) (default is ZERO)

      #2: Amount to move the sprite by Y points (float) (OPTIONAL) (example: 256) (default is ZERO)

      #3: Duration in seconds (float) (OPTIONAL) (example: 0.5) (default is 0.5 seconds)
          This measures how long it takes to move the sprite, in seconds.

      #4: Parallax factor (float) (OPTIONAL) (example: 0.5) (default is 0.95)
          The rate at which sprites move compared to the background. 1.00 means that the
          sprites move at exactly the same rate as the background, while 0.00 means that
          the sprites do not move at all. You'll probably want to set it something in between.

  Example: .MOVEBACKGROUND:100:0:1.0:0.99


================

  Name: .SETSPEAKER

  The "speaker name" is the title of the person speaking. If you set this to "nil" then it
  removes whatever the previous speaker name was.

  Parameters:

  Example: .setconversation:flirt sequence
 

================

  Name: .JUMPONCHOICE

  This presents the player with multiple choices. Each choice causes the scene to jump to a different
  "conversation" (or rather, an array in the script dictionary). The function can have multipe parameters,
  but the number should always be even-numbered.

  Parameters:

      #1: The name of the first action (shows up on button when player decides) (string) (example: "Run away")

  conversation/dialogue-sequence in the script.

  Parameters:

      #1: The name of the flag to be checked (string)

      #2: The expected value of the flag (integer)

      #3: The scene to jump to, if the flag's vaue matches the expected value in parameter #2 (string)

  Example: .JUMPONFLAG:should jump to beach scene:1:BeachScene


================

  Name: .SYSTEMCALL

  Used to do a "system call," which is usually game-specific. This command will try to contact the
  VNSystemCall class, and use it to perform some kind of particular task. Some examples of this would
  be starting a mini-game or some other activity that's specific to a particular app.

  Parameters:

      #1: The "call string" or a string that described what the activity/system-call type will be (string)

================

  Name: .CALLCODE

  This action can be used to call functions (usually from static objects). Careful when using it to
  call classes or functions that the VN system doesn't have access to! You may need to include header
  files from certain places if you really want to use certain classes.

  Parameters:

      #1: The name of the class to call (string)

      #2: The name of a static function to call (string)

  from the player.

  Parameters:

      #1: The time it takes (in seconds) to get to the next line of text/dialogue. (double)
          (Setting this to zero (or less) DISABLES cinematic text mode.)

  Sets or disables "typewriter text" mode, in which each character of text/dialogue appears
  one at a time (though usually still very quickly).

  Parameters:

      #1: How many characters it should print per second (Integer)
          (setting this to zero disables typewriter text mode)
